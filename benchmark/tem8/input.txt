Funding public transit is one of the biggest problems facing cities today . Often the trouble is that a few high-cost , low-ridership routes drag down an entire system . That puts policymakers in a tough spot . They might eliminate these unprofitable lines , that has been suggested before , but in doing so they would harm a considerate number of people who rely on that service as their primary mode of transportation .

Volpp and colleagues studied two kinds of incentive programs for weight loss . One was a lottery-based design in which participants played a lottery and were allowed to collect their winnings if they met their weight-loss target . The other was a deposit contract , in which participants invested small amount of their own money which they would lose at the end of the month if they succeeded to reach their goals . People in this group also got a bonus if they met their goal .
